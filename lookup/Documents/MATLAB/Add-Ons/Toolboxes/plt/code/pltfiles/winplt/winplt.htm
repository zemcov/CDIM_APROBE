<h1>Overview</h1>
Struggling with Matlab's FFT window display tool (wintool), I found it cumbersome
and limited. I wanted a way to quickly change window parameters and see the effect
on the time and frequency shapes and the most common window measures (scalloping
and processing loss, frequency resolution, and equivalent noise bandwidth).
I couldn't modify wintool for my taste since most of the code was hidden (pcode).
So I wrote winplt.m to create a more useble gui for displaying windows. winplt
displays traces showing the time and frequency domain shapes of 31 different FFT
windows and also is a tool for designing your own windows by adjusting the kernel
coefficients with a slider. You can also use winplt's command line interface to
return the window time shapes for use in your Matlab programs.
<br><br>
While working with this application, you may find the IEEE paper on Windows for
Harmonic Analysis (by Harris) useful. This is the most cited reference on FFT
windows and includes descriptions of most of the windows plotted by winplt.
For your convenience, you can get this paper from my website
(<a href="http://www.mennen.org">www.mennen.org</a>) in the section called
<i>"Signal processing papers"</i>.
<br><br>
Most treatmeants of FFT windows are highly mathematical (such as the Harris paper).
But if you want to understand some of the basic ideas without
the many pages of mind numbing equations, take a look at the this portion of a signal
processing talk I gave many years ago. The file is called <i>windowsTalk.pdf</i> and you can
find it on my web site, right next to the Harris paper mentioned above. 
<br><br>
Winplt is also a great example of gui programing using the
plt plotting tool, however if you are just getting started with gui
programming I would recommend starting first with one of the shorter
examples in the plt\demo folder.
<br><br>
Thirteen of the windows are defined by Matlab functions contained in
the signal processing toolbox. If that toolbox is not installed
you will see a warning that the function is not defined. (A boxcar
window is returned in that case). Seventeen of the windows are defined
in terms of a convolution kernel. Those windows (and the user defined
windows) will work correctly without any toolboxes installed.
<br><br>
If you know of some FFT windows I have not included, feel free to let
me know about them, and I will add them to the next release. Or if you
want to keep them secret, you will find it easy to add them to winplt
yourself. Also feel free to suggest new features. (You can always
reach me at the email address shown above).
<br><br>
Clicking on the Help tag (near the lower left corner of the figure) opens
the plt help file starting at topic with details about the winplt user interface
(i.e. the topic you are now reading). Navigate to the <b><i>Using the plt window</i></b>
section for instructions on display zooming/panning, enabling traces, and using the cursors.
<br><br>
<H1>Command-line interface</H1>

<font COLOR="#4040ff" face="Lucida Console"><b>winplt(id,points)</b></font> <br>
   The first parameter (id) refers to one of the 31 windows listed below,
   although the last two are user defined windows and can only be used from
   the gui interface.
   A column vector is returned
   (of length <font face="Lucida Console"><b>points</b></font>)
   containing the amplitude corrected window time shape. Amplitude correction
   means that the average value is one, i.e.:<br>
   <font face="Lucida Console"> &nbsp; &nbsp; sum(winplt(id,points)) = points</font>

<br><br> <font COLOR="#4040ff" face="Lucida Console"><b>winplt(id,points,1)</b></font> <br>
   Same as above except that the window is scaled using power correction. This
   means that the average value of the square of the window is one, i.e.:<br>
   <font face="Lucida Console"> &nbsp; &nbsp; sum(winplt(id,points,1).^2) = points</font>

<br><br> <font COLOR="#4040ff" face="Lucida Console"><b>winplt(id,points,pwr,opt)</b></font><br>
   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font face="Lucida Console"><b>id: &nbsp; &nbsp; </b></font>
              An index specifying one of the FFT windows<br>
   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font face="Lucida Console"><b>points: </b></font>
              The number of points in the time window to be generated<br>
   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font face="Lucida Console"><b>pwr:&nbsp; &nbsp; </b></font>
              0 = amplitude correction, 1 = power correction  (default = 0)<br>
   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font face="Lucida Console"><b>opt: &nbsp;&nbsp; </b></font>
              optional window parameter (used only for windows 1 thru 5 and 11)
   <br>
   This is the most general form of the winplt call.
   The return value is a column vector to be consistent with the Matlab window functions.
   Window id's 14 and 15 both return exactly the same Blackman window using different
   implementations (a good check that the code is correct).

<br><br> <font COLOR="#4040ff" face="Lucida Console"><b>[name, kernel] = winplt(id)</b></font> <br>
   Returns the name of the window associated with the specified id number (0 to 31)
   The second output argument (if given) will contain the convolution
   kernel. For windows not defined by a kernel the Matlab function
   used to compute it is returned, along with the window parameters.

<br><br> <font COLOR="#4040ff" face="Lucida Console"><b>winplt(-2)</b></font> <br>
   Returns a cell array containing all names of the defined windows.

<br><br> <font COLOR="#4040ff" face="Lucida Console"><b>winplt(-1)</b></font> <br>
   Displays a list of all windows and their id codes, which will look as follows:<br>

<H1>Graphical interface</H1>

To start the winplt graphical interface, simply type
<font COLOR="#4040ff" face="Lucida Console"><b>winplt</b></font> at the
Matlab command prompt (i.e. with no arguments). This opens a window
similar to this:
<br><br>
<img src="taylor.png"></p>

The solid green line is the frequency shape of the selected window
and the dashed green line is the time domain view.
<br><br>

<img src="help.png" hspace=10 align=left>
Click on the <font face="Lucida Console"><b>HelpP</b></font> tag
(near the lower left corner of the figure) to bring up the plt help file
plt.chm on Windows PC systems, and plt.htm otherwise. This is where you can find
instructions for zooming and panning the display, enabling traces, using the cursors and menus, etc.
<br><br>
When you click on the <font face="Lucida Console"><b>HelpW</b></font>
tag on PC Windows based systems the same plt.chm help file will appear as
when you clicked on the "HelpP" tag, however the help system will be initialized
so that the page describing winplt.m (that you are currently reading) will be
selected. On non-Windows systems, the HelpW tag will open winplt.htm in the browser.
<br clear="left"> <br>

<img src="popup.png" hspace=10 align=left>
Use the popup control (the large yellow text just above the plot)
to select one of 31 different windows - including most windows mentioned
in the literature and a few that I invented.
Left clicking on this control brings up the menu shown here with the currently
selected window highlighted. Simply click on the window you want to look at.
Alternatively, you may right click on this control and the window selection
will change to the next window in the sequence (ordered by the window ID).
When you select a window defined by a convolution kernel, that kernel appears
in the far upper right corner of the figure window.
<br clear="left"> <br>

<img src="bins.png" hspace=10 align=left>
Use the number of bins slider to control how many fft bins to plot
on either side of the center.
<br clear="left"> <br>


<img src="param.png" hspace=10 align=left>
For these window types (as well as Rife Vincent below), an additional slider
appears to the left of the # of bins slider. Note that the slider name as
well as the upper and lower slider limits change depending on the window
selected. As soon as you move the slider, the plot will be updated
to reflect the changed parameter.
<br clear="left"> <br>

<img src="rife.png" hspace=10 vspace=8 align=left>
Window ID 01 (Hanning/Rife Vincent) is unique in that the parameter slider
controls the number of times that the Hanning window is applied. So select 
<font COLOR="#4040ff" face="Lucida Console"><b>1</b></font>
to get the traditional Hanning window (the most popular of all windows), and select
<font COLOR="#4040ff" face="Lucida Console"><b>5</b></font>
to get the Hanning window applied 5 times (which is sometimes referred to as
the Rife Vincent 5 window). Note that if you set the parameter to zero, the
Hanning window is applied zero times which is equivalent to the
boxcar or rectangular window (ID=0).
In the example shown in this picture, the
Rife Vincent 3 window was selected. Note that the Rife Vincent 3 kernel is shown as:<br>
<font face="Lucida Console"><b>
[-.05 .3 -.75&nbsp; 1 -.75 .3 -.05]</b></font>
If we divide by the 1st term and take the absolute value we get:<br>
<font face="Lucida Console"><b>
[&nbsp; 1 &nbsp; 6 &nbsp; 15&nbsp; 20&nbsp; 15&nbsp; 6 &nbsp; 1 ]</b></font>
which you may recognize as the 6th row of Pascal's triangle.
<br clear="left"> <br>

<img src="scallop.png" hspace=10 align=left>
Whenever a new window is selected, or when any window parameters are
changed, these four window characteristics are computed and displayed
in the upper left corner of the plotting area. Green text is used to indicate
that the data is associated with the first two traces (also in green):
<br clear="left">
<ol>
<li><font COLOR="#4040ff" size=+1 <b>
Scalloping loss (dB):
</b></font>
    A measure of the uncertainty of the amplitude
    measurement due to the non-flatness of the frequency shape.
    It's computed as the difference between the maximum and minimum
    values of the frequency response between -.5 and +.5 bins.
</li>
<li><font COLOR="#4040ff" size=+1 <b>
6dB bandwidth (bins):
</b></font>
    A measure of frequency resolution. Indicates how precisely one can
    estimate the frequency of an input tone. A window with a wider main
    lobe will have a larger 6dB bandwidth and less certainty in the
    frequency measurement.
</li>
<li><font COLOR="#4040ff" size=+1 <b>
Equivalent Noise Bandwidth (bins):
</b></font>
    With white noise as an input, the enbw is the width of an ideal
    rectangular filter which would accumulate the same noise power as
    that obtained from the output of the window.
    The processing loss is equal to the square
    root of the enbw. For example if enbw = 2 bins, processing loss = 3dB.
</li>
<li><font COLOR="#4040ff" size=+1 <b>
Worst Case Processing loss (dB):
</b></font>
    This is the sum of the processing loss in dB (10*log10(enbw)) and
    the scalloping loss.
</li></ol>

Winplt remembers the previous two frequency and time shapes displayed.
These stored traces make it easy for you to compare two or three
different window types, or to compare up to three windows of the same
type but using a different parameter value. By default, only the first
two traces are enabled showing the you the frequency and time shapes
respectively of the currently selected window. The next two traces
(shown in blue on the plot as well as in the TraceID box) show the
window that was selected previously to the current one. Note that the
TraceIDs are in italics indicating that the trace is disabled. Simply
click on the TraceID to change it to a bold font and enable the trace
on the display. (You can't do this until you have selected at least one
other window, since otherwise there is no meaning to "previously selected".)
Likewise, the last two traces (shown in red) show the "previous previous"
window. If you don't know what that means, read the example situation below:
<br clear="left"> <br>
Suppose you select these three windows, in this order, using the popup control:
<ul>
<font COLOR="#4040ff" face="Lucida Console"><b>
<li> 12:  Hamming          </li>
<li> 23:  FlatTop (5 term) </li>
<li> 21:  Potter 210       </li>
</ul>
</b></font>
The trace ID box will then have trace labels as shown in the above picture.
The first trace will show the frequency shape of the Potter 210 window
(since that is the window currently selected) and its trace ID will
be "Freq21". The third trace will have an ID of "Freq23" and if
enabled will show the 5 term FlatTop frequency shape since that was the
shape previously shown. The fifth trace will have an ID of "Freq12"
and if enabled will show the Hamming frequency shape since that was
the shape "previously, previously" shown. The 2th, 4th, and 6th traces
will display the time traces associated with the frequency plots just
mentioned. If you need to compare more than 3 different windows at once, the
easiest option is to start multiple copies of the winplt application.
<br><br>

Note that when either of the blue traces is enabled (Freq23/Time23 in the
above example) the four window characteristics of the previous window are
also displayed on the right side of the graph. This is shown in blue to remind
you that it is associated with the trace of the same color (i.e. traces 3 and 4).
This second set of text strings for the previous window makes it easy to compare
these characteristics between two windows. And again if you need to quickly
compare these numbers for more than two windows, just open multiple copies of winplt.
<br><br>

<img src="pwrcorrect.png" hspace=10 align=left>
On the right side of the graph (above the right axis label) is a
checkbox called "power corrected". When checked (as it is by default)
the time trace is power corrected. When this checkbox is unchecked,
the time trace is amplitude corrected. The meanings of power and amplitude
correction are described above in the command-line interface section.
<br clear="left"><br>

<img src="id30.png" hspace=10 align=left>
The simplest way to experiment
with your own window designs is to first
select one of the kernel based windows that most resembles the window
you want. (Those are the windows that have the kernel displayed above
the window name, including IDs 1,12,13,14, and 17 through 28). Then when
you switch to ID 30 (adjust kernel) you can modify the selected kernel
element by using the slider labeled "Parameter". (The selected kernel
element is indicated by bold text and is surrounded by parentheses).
At first the last (right most) kernel element will be selected as shown
in this figure. To select a different kernel element simply click anywhere
on the kernel list and the selected element will move one position to the
left (in a circular fashion). If you want to enter a particular number
for the selected kernel element, just type that number into the parameter slider
edit box. Usually however you will want to use the slider arrows to
adjust the value. Clicking on the slider right / left arrows will
increase / decrease (respectively) the kernel value by one part in
2000 (i.e. by 0.05%). You can change the increment factor by entering
a value of 100 or greater into the slider edit box. For example to set
the increment factor to 1 part in 10,000 (i.e. 0.01%) just enter "1e4"
into the parameter slider. Clicking in the trough area of the parameter
slider changes the kernel element by 10 times as much as for the slider
arrows. Note that the frequency and time domain plots instantly update
every time the selected kernel element is modified. This instant feedback
may allow you to get a feel for how you want to modify the kernel, but
even with this feedback it is difficult for all but the shortest kernels.
<br clear="left"><br>

<img src="id30popup.png" hspace=10 align=left>If you right click anywhere on
the kernel, instead of moving left as you get with the left click you will see
this popup selection. The first two selections (Move right/left) are not
often useful since it is faster to just use the left click method.
The next two choices add or remove a kernel element respectively.
There are two ways to save the kernel as you currently have modified it.
The first method "Save" simply saves the kernel to temporary memory (which
will be lost when you close winplt.m. (Selecting "Revert" restores the kernel
from this temporary memory). To save the kernel in a more permanent way, select
the choice "Write winplt.mat" which will save the kernel in the same folder
containing winplt.m with the indicated file name. This kernel is reloaded
when you click on the "Load winplt.mat" selection. You will find both methods
of saving the current kernel useful as you explore the effects of modifying
each element while searching for the desired characteristics. The last choice
is for closing the menu if it was selected inadvertently.
<br clear="left"><br>

<img src="id31.png" hspace=10 align=left>
To display your own window design based on a convolution kernel, the
selection above (ID=30) is usually the easiest. But if you don't want
to be limited to that design technique, you can display your own window
designed in a completely general way by selecting the last window type
in the popup control
<font face="Lucida Console"><b> (ID&nbsp;31:&nbsp;user)</b></font>.
The current user function string will then appear directly above the popup control.
If you haven't entered such a string yet, the default userwin string
is shown which is simply
<font COLOR="#4040ff" face="Lucida Console"><b> userwin(points,param)</b></font>.
If you don't have a function named userwin on your Matlab path, then you will
also get the undefined function error message shown in this picture. Any other
errors encountered when winplt is computing the user defined window will also
appear in this location.
<br><br>
The easiest way to display your own window definition is to create a Matlab file called
<font COLOR="#4040ff" face="Lucida Console"><b> userwin.m</b></font>
containing a function of your own design called userwin with two input
arguments and a single output argument. The first argument is the number of
time points to return and the second argument is a window parameter.
(It's easiest to include the 2nd argument in the calling sequence even if you
don't need a window parameter. That way there is no need to modify the userwin string.)
And of course the output argument is the returned time window which normally
will be a vector of the length specified by the first input argument.
<br><br>
If you want to modify the user function string, just click on it.
The string will change colors to indicate "edit mode" and an underline
cursor will appear. The left/right arrow keys and the delete/backspace
keys will work as expected as you are editing the string.
<br><br>
For simple functions, you can enter the computation itself as the userwin
string. For example, to display a triangular window, enter this as the
userwin string:<br>

<font face="Lucida Console"><b>[1:2:points  points:-2:1]</b></font><br>

You don't have to worry about whether the result is a row or a column
since winplt will convert it to a column either way. In fact you don't
even have to get the size correct since winplt will truncate or zero
pad it to make it the correct length (i.e. "points").

One thing you can use the user string for is to combine windows in various
ways. For example, try entering something like:<br>
<font face="Lucida Console"><b>chebwin(points,param) + winplt(27,points)</b></font><br>
In response, winplt will compute a new window which is the sum of the Chebyshev
window and the Mennen 501 FlatTop window (ID 27). Note that the parameter slider
value will be used in the Chebyshev portion since it includes the string "param"
which gets replaced with the current value of the slider. Note that the
string "points" must be used to indicate the number of points in the returned
window function. The adjustable parameter can be used in many other ways in the
userwin function. One example is to use it as a weighting between two predefined
window functions as in this user string:<br>

<font face="Lucida Console"><b>
winplt(21,points)*param + winplt(22,points)*(100-param)</b></font><br>
This will create a user window identical to ID 21 when the parameter
slider is at 0 and identical to ID 22 when the slider is
at 100. (In between of course it will be a mixture of the two.)

You could also use the user window to display one of the standard
winplt window selections, but with a different choice of parameters.
For example, suppose you want to show the taylor window with nbar=8 instead of the
nbar=5 used by window ID 11. Note that taylorwin (from the signal processing toolbox)
is defined as follows: function w = taylorwin(points,nbar,dBsidelobes).
So suppose we enter the following user string:<br>

<font face="Lucida Console"><b>taylorwin(points,8,-abs(param))</b></font><br>
Winplt will then show the taylor window with the nbar parameter set to 8.
The sidelobe level will be controlled by the parameter slider.
Since taylorwin expects the sidelobe level expressed in dB as a negative number,
the negative absolute value was used to avoid the error message that would
otherwise result when the parameter slider is moved to a positive number.
If instead of changing the sidelobe level, you wanted to see the effect of
changing the nbar parameter with the sidelobe level set to -90dB you would enter:<br>
<font face="Lucida Console"><b>taylorwin(points,param,-90)</b></font>

<h1>Notes</h1>
<ol>
<li>Matlab's window functions return windows with a normalized scaling
(i.e. with a max value of one), although that type of scaling has little
use in spectral analysis. Using winplt, you can compute a normalized
window as follows:<br>
   <font face="Lucida Console">
   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; w = winplt(id,points);<br>
   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; w = w/max(w);<br>
   </font>
</li>
<li>
You will notice that for some of the flat top windows, the
sum(winplt(id,points)) is slightly less than points. This is on purpose,
and is done to minimize the scalloping loss. The scaling for the power
corrected windows is always exact however.
