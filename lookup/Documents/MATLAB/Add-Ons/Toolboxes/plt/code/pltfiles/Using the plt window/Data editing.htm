<br><h1>Data editing</h1> <br clear="left"><br><br>

plt has the capability to modify the plotted data, either one
point at a time or over a specified range. Data entry is accomplished
by entering the coordinates via the keyboard or by using the mouse
when keyboard accuracy is not required. (An alternate method of data 
editing appropriate for short data sequences is described in the
<a href="Menu%20box.htm">Menu box </a>section.)
<br><br>
<img src="../images/DataEdit.png" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10">
<br>The first step is to click on the trace containing the data that you wish to edit. 
The second step is to right-click on the Ycursor edit box. (This is 
the edit box closest to the lower right corner of the figure.) When you do 
that, a popup menu will appear with the list of 13 choices shown here. The first three items in this menu,
don't really have anything to do with data editing, but this was a convenient place to put them.
When you select the first menu item (<span class="mcode">Properties</span>) one of three different
property editing windows will appear depending on how it is selected. When you left-click on
&quot;Properties&quot; a window appears which allows you to modify the color and other properties of the
currently selected line and its cursor. If before clicking on &quot;Properties&quot; you enable delta
cursor mode  (&Delta; button) then a property windows appears which allows you to edit all the lines at once.
This is often appropriate for the color property, but it also may be useful for some of the other 
trace properties, such as linewidth. And finally, if instead of left-clicking you
right-click on &quot;Properties&quot; then a window appears that allows you to 
edit the figure colors. This is the easiest method of accessing the three 
property editing windows, although for historical reasons there are two additional ways of opening 
these windows. One is via the &quot;Colors/Lines&quot; selection of the menu bar and the 
other is via right-clicking the &quot;Mark&quot; tag in the menu box. Both of these 
methods are mentioned in the <a href="Menu%20box.htm">Menu box </a> &nbsp;section 
which also has a full description of the three different property editing windows 
and how to use them.
<br><br>
The second menu choice (<span class="mcode">multiCursor</span>) toggles the multiCursor mode which
is described here in the <a href="Cursoring.htm">Cursoring</a> section and third menu choice
(<span class="mcode">xView slider</span>) toggles the xView slider which is 
described here in the <a href="Zooming%20and%20panning.htm">Zooming and panning</a> section
<br><br>
The fourth menu choice (<span class="mcode">Cancel</span>) is 
useful if you opened this popup menu accidentally or when 
you want to abort an already initiated data editing operation.
<br><br>
The remaining nine selections in this popup contain the actual data editing commands. 
The descriptions below are written for completeness rather 
than brevity so don't be scared off. The commands are intuitive, so you may be better off
skipping the descriptions at first 
in favor of experimentation. The nine editing commands are divided into these three types:
<br><br>

<table border="1" cellpadding="8" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#b0b0b0" width="100%">
  	<tr>	<td><center><b>Modify</b></center></td>
		<td>The modify commands change the x or y (or both) coordinates of a 
		single data point. When using these commands, the length of 
		the x and y vectors do not change. </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>	<td><center><b>Insert</b></center></td>
		<td>The insert commands add a new xy data pair to the data at the 
		current cursor point. When using these data editing commands, the length 
		of the x and y vectors increase by one. The one exception to that is that
		when you attempt to add a new data pair with its y value less than the
		current minimum y-axis limit, then the data at the current cursor point
		is removed from the data set (i.e. the length of the x and y vectors
		decrease by one).</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>    <td><center><b>Range</b></center></td>
		<td>With the range commands (as with modify) the length of 
		the x and y vectors remain the same. However in this case more than one 
		data point is changed. All the data points between the current cursor 
		location and the location modified during the previous data editing 
		command are modified so that all these points lie on a straight line 
		connecting the two end locations. For this to work, the previously 
		edited point and the current cursor location must both lie on the same 
		line. If this is not true, then the Range commands 
		behave just like the Modify commands described above, and you will know
		happened because the cursor shape will be consistent with a Modify
		command. (See cursor shapes table below).</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<br>
The nine commands are also categorized into three modes identified by the arrows next to each command as follows:
<br><br>
<table border="1" cellpadding="8" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#b0b0b0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td><center><b><font size="+1">Modify&uarr;&darr;<br>Insert&uarr;&darr;<br>Range&uarr;&darr;</font></b></center></td>
    <td>These are the three most commonly used data editing modes. As soon as you select the 
	editing mode, the regular data cursor disappears and is replaced by an 
	editing cursor with a different shape. (See data editing cursor shapes 
	below). Then you can grab the edit cursor with the mouse and drag it to the 
	desired location. However you will only be able to move the cursor up and 
	down (i.e. only the y coordinate is 
        allowed to change). Normally as soon as you release the mouse button (after 
	the edit cursor has been dragged to its new location) the edit command will 
	take effect, the edit cursor will disappear, and the normal data cursor will 
	reappear. However if instead of using the normal left mouse button, you drag the edit cursor 
	using the right mouse button, then when you release the mouse the edit 
	command will take effect but the edit cursor will remain active. This makes 
	it easier to see the effect of the edit and easily re-adjust if necessary. 
	Once you are satisfied with the edit command you can regain the normal data 
	cursor mode by selecting &quot;Cancel&quot; (the second popup option mentioned above) 
	or more quickly just by clicking anywhere in the plot area other than the 
	edit cursor itself. In addition to moving the edit cursor with the mouse, 
	you can also move the edit cursor more precisely by typing a new y value 
	into the Ycursor edit box. (You can also modify the x coordinate by typing a new x value into the Xcursor edit box despite the fact that you can't 
	change the x value when using the mouse.) After you type a value into 
	either the x or y cursor edit box, the edit command takes effect and the 
	data edit mode is immediately canceled and the original data cursor is 
	restored (i.e. there is no provision for a delayed exit from edit mode like 
	you get using the right mouse button). If you would rather stay in edit mode 
	until cancelled explicitly, just use one of the three commands without any 
	arrows after it (described below). </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><center><b><font size="+1">Modify&harr;<br>Insert&harr;<br>Range&harr;</font></b></center></td>
    <td>These three commands behave identically to the three commands described above except for the
        fact that with the mouse you can only drag the cursor left or right (i.e. only the x coordinate 
        is allowed to change).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><center><b><font size="+1">Modify<br>Insert<br>Range</font></b></center></td>
    <td>When using these three commands	you can use the mouse to drag the edit cursor anywhere.
        As before the editing mode is cancelled as soon as you release the mouse button (unless you 
	used the right mouse button). As mentioned above, the use of the X and Y cursor edit boxes is
	slightly different in that it stays in edit mode until you cancel it explicitly (usually by
	clicking anywhere in the plot area).</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br>
The currently enabled cursor can be put into data editing mode from a program as well.
For example the command <nobr><span class="mcode">plt click Yedit 12;</span></nobr>
or its functional form <nobr><span class="mcode">plt('click','Yedit',12);</span></nobr>
puts the cursor into the "modify left/right" mode, since that is the 12th selection
in the menu shown above.
<br><br>
<img src="../images/EditCur.png" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10">
<br>The usual data cursor is a plus sign or a small circle. Once you select one of the 
nine editing modes, the data cursor changes to one of the nine edit cursors 
shown in this figure. Although it wouldn't really be necessary to have a different 
cursor for each mode, it does help you remember what mode you are currently in. 
If you don't like the default size that plt chooses for the data edit cursors, 
you can change this with a command such as: <span class="mcode">
setappdata(gcf,'CurEdit',14)</span>. The new size will be used the next time a 
cursor edit mode is selected.
<br><br>
If plt was called using the <span class="mcode">MotionEdit</span> parameter, the 
function specified with that parameter will be called continuously as you 
drag the edit cursor around. This function may be used to create or modify text, 
plots or other gui objects on the screen. Both the <span class="mcode">editz.m</span>
and  <span class="mcode">pltquiv.m</span> examples demonstrate the use of the MotionEdit
parameter. (Also see <a href="../Programming%20with%20plt/Cursor%20commands.htm">Mouse Motion Functions</a>)
<br><br>
If you want to save the altered data (to a file for example) you have to get the 
data from the 'xdata' and 'ydata' properties of the line handle. (Remember the 
line handles are returned by the plt call.) When the user modifies any data 
using these data editing functions, plt executes the user specified move cursor 
callback. (See the description of the <span class="mcode">'set','moveCB'</span> 
function <a href="../Programming%20with%20plt/Cursor%20commands.htm">here</a>.) 
The callback routine or any other part of your application can use the <span class="mcode">'NewData'</span> 
application property of the current figure window to determine if data has been 
modified by one of the data edit commands. For example:
<br clear="left">

<br><span class="mcode">index = getappdata(gcf,'NewData'); </span>% returns the index where xdata/ydata was modified
<br><span class="mcode">if index &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
				 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
                                 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span>% is there any new data?
<br><span class="mcode">&nbsp; DataWasModifiedAction(index); &nbsp; &nbsp;</span>% yes, process the new data
<br><span class="mcode">&nbsp; setappdata(gcf,'NewData',0); &nbsp; &nbsp; </span> % indicate that the data was already processed
<br><span class="mcode">end;</span>
<br><br>
Note that the <span class="mcode">NewData</span> property only gets set after a data edit 
operation is complete, unlike the <span class="mcode">MotionEdit</span> function 
which gets called as you are dragging a cursored value to its new location. 
There is one additional figure application data variable called
<span class="mcode">Dedit</span> that may also be useful for an application 
using the data editing feature. The command <span class="mcode">
getappdata(gcf,'Dedit')</span> will return the following 9 element row vector:<br><br>

<table border="1" cellpadding="8" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#b0b0b0" width="100%">
        <caption><font size="+2" color="#4040ff"><i><b>'Dedit' figure application data (row vector)</b></i></font></caption>
  	<tr>	<td><center><b>1</b></center></td>
		<td>The CursorID associated with the edited trace </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>	<td><center><b>2</b></center></td>
		<td>A number from 1 to 9 which identifies which data edit command 
                    is being used. (This is starting from the top of the popup,
		    so 1 indicates the "Range" selection and 9 indicates
		    the "Modify&uarr;&darr;" selection).</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>    <td><center><b>3</b></center></td>
		<td>The handle of the cursor object associated with the modified data.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>	<td><center><b>4,5,6</b></center></td>
		<td>For internal use. (This saves the cursor marker shape, size, and linewidth so
		that the normal cursor can be restored when the data edit operation is complete.)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>    <td><center><b>7,8</b></center></td>
		<td>For internal use. (This saves the position index and trace number of the
		previously edited trace - information is needed for the modify range operations.)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>    <td><center><b>9</b></center></td>
		<td>The position index of the cursor into the edited trace</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<br>
After performing a data edit operation it is likely that you will want to 
perform another data edit using the same data edit command. Thus it would be 
nice if you could initiate another data edit operation without having to again 
select one of the nine data editing operations. In fact there is a way to do 
this - simply right-click on the Xcursor edit box. This behaves similarly to 
what happens when you right-click on the Ycursor edit box except you don't get 
the menu of data editing choices, since it will use your previous selection. 
There has to be a default for this operation in case the user right-clicks on 
the Xcursor edit box before doing any other data edit operation. The default is 
&quot;Modify&quot; since this is the most commonly used operation. It is rare 
to want to change this default, although it is not difficult to do so. In fact the
<span class="mcode">demo\editz.m</span> demo program changes this default, so 
refer to that example to see how it is done.
