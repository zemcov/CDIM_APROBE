    <td>You specify which traces should appear on the right-hand axis with the <span class="mcode">

      <nobr><span class="mcode">'Right',[1&nbsp;4:2:10&nbsp;17]</span></nobr>
      in the parameter list, then plt would put trace numbers 1,4,6,8,10, 
      and 17 on the right axis and all other traces on the left axis. A slight 
      shading is used behind the Trace IDs associated with the right hand axis 
      so you can tell at a glance which traces belong to which axis. (You can
      disable this shading if you prefer. To see how, read the description of
      the TraceID parameter below). You can 
      also tell which axis a trace is on by the shape of its cursor ('+' for 
      left axis and 'o' for the right axis). You can optionally specify a 
      label for the right hand axis (see <span class="mcode">LabelY</span>) as well 
      as the axis limits (see <span class="mcode">YlimR</span>).
      Specifying an empty list, as in <nobr><span class="mcode">'Right',[]</span></nobr>
      tells plt to use the left axis for all the traces (the same as if you omitted
      the Right parameter altogether.)<br>

      <h3>Markers</h3>
      </td></tr></table>
    </td>
    <td>The Markers parameter is a shorthand way of setting a different marker 
      property for each line. For example:
      <br><br>
      <span class="mcode">plt(x,y,'Markers',s)</span>
      <br><br>
      is equivalent to:
      <br><br>
      <span class="mcode">a = plt(x,y);<br>
            for k=1:length(a) set(a(k),'Marker',s(k,:)); end;</span>
      <br><br>
      The argument may be an array of characters or a cell array of strings. The latter method
      is easier when the elements are different sizes because you don't have to pad with blanks 
      as with the character array. (Wherever a character array is allowed in a plt 
      argument list, a cell array of strings is also allowed and visa versa.)
      For example, these two lines have give the same result:
      <br><br>
      <span class="mcode">plt(...,'Markers',['square';'+ &nbsp;&nbsp; ';'none ']);</span><br>
      <span class="mcode">plt(...,'Markers',{'square','+','none'});</span>
      <br><br>
      This sets the marker for the first two lines to a square and a plus sign respectively
      while the third line will be rendered without any markers.
      <br><br>
      The following example shows two ways to set the markers of the six traces to
      x,+,square,o,asterisk,x (respectively). The shorter method used in the 2nd line is
      possible because every marker may be represented with a single character:
      <br><br>
      <span class="mcode">plt(...,'Markers',['x';'+';'s';'o','*','x']);</span><br>
      <span class="mcode">plt(...,'Markers','x+so*x');</span>

      <h3>Styles</h3>
      </td></tr></table>
    </td>
    <td>The Styles parameter is a shorthand way of setting the LineStyle property in 
    a similar way that the Markers parameter is used to set the Marker property. For example, to set the first 
    trace to normal, the 2nd and 3rd traces to dotted and dashed respectively, and 
    the 4th trace to none (useful when you want the markers with no lines connecting 
    them) you would use the following command:
    <br><br>    
    <span class="mcode">plt(...,'Styles',{'-',':','--','none'});</span>
    <br><br>
    The shorthand for single character styles mentioned above also works. For 
    instance, to alternate between normal and dotted among eight traces one could use:
    <br><br>
    <span class="mcode">plt(...,'Styles','-:-:-:-:');</span>
    <br><br>
    One additional trick applies to the Styles parameter. If a single character 
    is given which is not a valid line style, then the linestyle property is set to 
    none and the given character is applied to the marker property. As an example, 
    the following command defines eight traces of which the first four are rendered 
    as continuous lines (i.e. without markers) and the last four are rendered with
    plus sign markers placed at each x,y location specified by the data arrays but
    with no lines connecting the markers:
    <br><br>
    <span class="mcode">plt(...,'Styles','----++++');</span>
    <br><br>    
    Since there are no marker property values which can also be linestyle 
    property values, there is never any ambiguity as to which property should be set.

      </td></tr></table>
    </td>
    <td>This parameter allows you to assign a name to each trace. This name will 
    appear in the trace selection box (also sometimes called the TraceID box).
    The number of characters that will fit in the 
    trace selection box depends on the size you choose for the plt window. For the 
    default figure size there is room for about 5 uppercase or 6 lowercase characters. In 
    the example below, both forms are equivalent:
    <br><br>
    <span class="mcode">plt(...,'TraceID',['Rtemp';'Ltemp';'RV1&nbsp; ']);<br>
    plt(...,'TraceID',{'Rtemp';'Ltemp';'RV1'});</span>
    <br><br>
    <i>Default:</i><span class="mcode"> ['Line 1';'Line 2';&nbsp;...&nbsp;'Line n'];</span>
    <br><br>
    If you want the plot to be created without a TraceID box, call plt with a 
    TraceID parameter of zero or the empty set ([] or ''). Since plt can't create a 
    TraceID box containing more than 99 IDs, if you want to plot more than 99 
    traces, you must include <span class="mcode">'TraceID',0</span>&nbsp;
    (or with the equivalent empty set value) in the parameter list.
    <br><br>
    When specifying traceIDs, you must have one trace ID for every trace on the main and
    right hand axes. However if you don't want a trace ID for a specific trace to appear, just use the null string
    (<span class="mcode">''</span>) for the trace name. If you do that, the trace ID
    box will be made smaller to account for the fewer number of IDs displayed.
    <br><br>
    Normally traceIDs associated with the right hand axis will appear in the traceID box
    with a slight shading so you can identify those traces at a glance. If you want to
    disable this shading, insert the special character ']' at the beginning of the first
    TraceID name. The right bracket will be removed from the trace name before it is used.
    The third plot of the <span class="mcode">pub.m</span> demo program demonstrates the use of this special character.
    <br><br>
    You may specify a callback function (fcn) to execute when the user clicks on 
    any of the TraceID tags by including the&nbsp; parameter <span class="mcode">'TIDcback',fcn</span> 
    in the argument list. If the 
    string <span class="mcode">'@TID'</span> occurs anywhere inside the 
    function string then it's replaced with the handle of the 
    trace ID string. Likewise if the string <span class="mcode">'@LINE'</span> 
    occurs anywhere inside fcn, it is replaced with the handle of 
    the trace itself and occurrences of <span class="mcode">'@IDX'</span>
    are replaced with the index of the selected trace. (i.e. 2 for the second
    trace listed in the TraceID box). See the demo program <span class="mcode">
    pltquiv.m </span>for an example using the <span class="mcode">TIDcback</span> 
    parameter. In that example, the name and color of a trace is displayed in the 
    command window when you click on a Trace ID tag. (Not particularly useful, but 
    this example was contrived to demonstrate all the possible substitutions.) To 
    define a quote within a quote in Matlab, one uses two single quote characters in 
    a row. Since this can get confusing at times, callbacks defined within plt may 
    use a double quote character instead of two successive single quotes. The 
    pltquiv.m example uses this alternative form. In addition to a string,
    <span class="mcode">fcn</span> may also be a function handle of the form <span class="mcode">
    @func</span> or <span class="mcode">{@func,arg1,arg2,...,argn}</span>. Note that 
    the string substitutions can't be used with the function handle form of this 
    parameter.
    <br><br>
    You also may change the traceIDs after the plot has been created. For 
    example, if the current figure contains a plot with four traces, these traces 
    can be renamed with a command such as:
    <br><br>
    <span class="mcode">plt('rename',{'First'&nbsp;'Second'&nbsp;'3rd'&nbsp;'4th'});</span>
    <br><br>
    If there are other changes you want to make to the TraceID box from your
    program (as in the <span class="mcode">curves.m</span> example), you can get the handle of the axis that 
    contains all the TraceID objects with the following command:
    <br><br>
    <span class="mcode">tbox = findobj(gcf,'user','TraceID');</span>
    <br><br>
    Then, for example the following command would make the TraceID box invisible:
    <br><br>
    <span class="mcode">set([tbox;&nbsp;get(tbox,'child')],'vis','off')</span>
    <br><br>
    An easier way to make the TraceID box invisible would be to simply move it outside the figure area:
    <br><br>
    <span class="mcode">set(tbox,'pos',[-2 0 1 1])</span>.
    <br><br>
    Or in the unlikely event you wanted to reverse the order of the TraceIDs (i.e. bottom to top
    ordering in the TraceID box), use the command:
    <br><br>
    <span class="mcode">set(tbox,'view',[0&nbsp;270])</span>.

    </td>
    <td>This parameter allows you to show the line types in the trace selection box
    to help identify the traces. This can be visually pleasing and is especially helpful if you
    are color blind. If the argument is a vector, it specifies the 
    marker positions within the trace selection box. For example
    <nobr><span class="mcode">'TraceMK',[.6 .7 .8 .9]</span></nobr> would tell plt to place a 
    horizontal line next to each TraceID label beginning and ending at x = .6 
    and .9 with markers at the four locations specified (assuming the line type 
    in the plot included markers). The area between x = 0 and .6 (i.e. the first 60%) would be 
    used for the text label. If the first element of the vector is less than .25 
    then plt will not display the text labels since there probably would not be 
    room for them anyway. (Clicking on the lines in the TraceID box have the 
    same effect as clicking on the labels, so the labels can be removed without 
    loss of functionality). If the argument is a scalar, plt will use that value 
    as the first element of a length 3 vector whose last element is .9. Thus
    <nobr><span class="mcode">'TraceMK',.6</span></nobr> is shorthand for
    <nobr><span class="mcode">'TraceMK',[.6 .75 .9]</span></nobr>. A special case is when the 
    scalar argument is zero, in which case no lines are inserted into the 
    trace selection box (as if the <span class="mcode">TraceMK</span> parameter was not used at all). See the 
    demo programs <span class="mcode">trigplt.m </span>and <span class="mcode">

    </td>
    <td>All TraceIDs will appear in the trace selection box (aka TraceID box) in a
    single column except when the TIDcolumn parameter is included. This is useful when you are
    using so many traces that the TraceID box becomes too crowded to fit all the trace names in
    a single column. The simplest way to use the TIDcolumn parameter is to supply an empty
    argument to the parameter (i.e. <span class="mcode">''</span> or
    <span class="mcode">[]</span>). When this is done plt will use just a single column
    for the TraceID box when the number of traces is 24 or less. Two columns will be used
    when the number of traces is between 25 and 48, and three columns will be used when
    there are more than 48 traces. (The TraceID box will not appear when more than
    99 traces have been defined). This default will probably work in nearly all situations
    but if you want exact control over how many columns are used and how many traceIDs
    appear in each column, you can do that by specifying a non-empty argument to the
    TIDcolumn parameter as follows:
    If<span class="mcode"> TIDcolumn</span> is a scalar, it specifies the number of 
    TraceIDs to put in the <i><b>second</b></i> column. If it is a vector, it 
    specifies the number of TraceIDs to put in columns 2,3,etc, with the 
    remaining going into column 1. For example, if 30 traces are displayed, and 
    you use
    <nobr><span class="mcode">'TIDcolumn',8</span></nobr>&nbsp; then the first 22 TraceIDs 
    appear in the first column and the last 8 appear in the second column.
    <nobr><span class="mcode">'TIDcolumn',[5&nbsp;5&nbsp;5]</span></nobr> would tell plt to arrange the 
    30 IDs in four columns as follows: (1-15, 16-20, 21-25, 26-30).

    <td>By default, all the traces defined by plt are visible until you change that 
    from the trace selection box. You can change the default by disabling some 
    traces from the plt call. For example:
    <br><br>
    <nobr><span class="mcode">plt(...,'DIStrace',[1 1 0 0 0]);</span></nobr>
    <br><br>
    This tells plt to start the display with the first two traces disabled and 
    the remaining 3 traces enabled. Of course you can later enable the first two 
    traces via the trace selection box. If the parameter has fewer elements than the 
    number of traces, it is extended by adding zeros. This means that we could have 
    used <span class="mcode">[1&nbsp;1]</span> above to the same effect. After the

    <td>This parameter allows you to reserve space for additional traces to be added to the figure
        after the plt window has been started. For example
        <span class="mcode">plt(x1,y1,x2,y2,'+',5);</span> opens the plt window with two traces,
        the first one defined by x1,y1 and the second one by x2,y2. Then room is reserved in the
        TraceID box for up to 5 more traces that can be added using the
        <span class="mcode">pltt.m</span> function. This parameter is normally only used inside
        script or function files because when you type the plt command in the Matlab command window
        an automatic <span class="mcode">'+',8</span> is assumed. You could still include the +
        parameter from the command window in the unlikely event you were planning on adding more
        than 8 traces. When plt is called from a script or function, you can't add traces after
        the plt window has opened unless you had included the + parameter in the argument list.
        <br><br>
        It is unusual to want to add dozens of traces with the pltt function, but it is possible.
        For example with the command <span class="mcode">plt(x,y,'+',39,'TIDcolumn','');</span>
        plt will reserve space in the TraceID box for 40 traces. The first is specified
        in the plt command and the remaining 39 can be added using the <span class="mcode">pltt</span>
        function. The TIDcolumn parameter was needed in this case because without it, plt would
        attempt to cram all 40 TraceIDs into one column which would probably be unreadable.
        <br><br>
        You may include the <span class="mcode">TraceID</span> parameter in the argument list as
        well if you like, and you should be aware that there are two ways of doing this. The first
        (and by far the most common) way of doing this is to put the 'TraceID' parameter before the
        <span class="mcode">'+'</span> in the argument list. When done in that order, that TraceID
        argument specifies the trace names only for the traces defined in the argument list. Then
        when the '+' parameter is encountered, plt expands the TraceID list using default names
        that will usually be overwritten by the trace names included in the calls to
        <span class="mcode">pltt</span>. When done in the opposite order, the TraceID argument should
        include the trace names you want for the traces that will be added later (even though the
        trace names will be invisible until those traces are added). And if the TraceID argument
        does not include enough trace names for this, when a trace is added after the list has
        been exhausted, the new trace will be added without any corresponding entry in the TraceID box
        (which occasionally might even be what you wanted).
        <br><br>
        Typically the + parameter is placed after all the traces defined inside the plt argument list,
        however this is not strictly necessary. In fact multiple + parameters may be included and they
        may be interspersed with the trace definitions in the parameter list. When you do that, the
        space reserved in the TraceID box for the traces to be added later will be interspersed with the
        defined traces in the order in which they appeared. This flexibility is rarely needed, but
        nevertheless it is available if you want it. Note that when traces are added with the pltt
        function, the reserved slots are used in order (top to bottom, as well as left to right if
        multiple columns were enabled).
        <br><br>
        You might expect that when all the free slots in the TraceID box have been used up, you
        can no longer add a new trace with the pltt function ... but in fact you can. What happens
        is that in this situation, pltt will overwrite the data and the trace name of the last trace
        that was added, so effectively you can never run out of free slots (unless you never allocated
        any in the first place).
