<br><h1>Menu box</h1> <br clear="left"><br><br>

<img src="../images/MenuBox.png" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10">

<br>By default, the menu box contains the 8 items shown in this figure.
Some or all of these items may be missing if they were specifically excluded
by using the <span class="mcode">'Options'</span> argument in the calling sequence.
The name of each menu box items are chosen to identify the action when you left
click on the item. The action corresponding to a right click are less obvious, but
a quick look at the plt menu (see below) will remind you what these actions are.
<br><br>
See <span class="mcode">pltquiv.m</span>&nbsp; for an example of how you can change one of the
menu box items to perform an alternate function.
<br><br>
Details about each menu box item follows:
<br clear="left">

<h3>Help</h3>

On Windows systems when you left or right click on the the
<span class="mcode">Help</span> tag, plt will display the file
<span class="mcode">plt.chm</span>. On Unix and other systems the browser 
will be opened to display the file
<span class="mcode">plt.htm</span> (since these systems don't support the 
chm file format). The left click behavior may be modified by including the
<span class="mcode">'HelpFile'</span>  parameter on the command line and
the right click behavior may be modified by including the
<span class="mcode">'HelpFileR'</span>  parameter. Those parameters are described
<a href="../Programming%20with%20plt/Options.htm">here</a>.

<h3>LinX</h3>

Left-clicking this tag changes the x-axis scale from linear to logarithmic.
The name of the tag itself also toggles between <span class="mcode">LinX</span>
and <span class="mcode">LogX</span> so that it the tag name always matches the
current x-axis scaling type. Left-clicking again toggles it back to
<span class="mcode">LinX</span>.
<br><br>
Right-clicking this tag swaps the x and y data for all the traces which has the
effect of displaying the inverse function of the original display. This swapping
works best when only a single axis is being used. For multiple axes (i.e. with
a right hand axis or with subplots) the effect might not quite what you expect.

<h3>LinY</h3>

The y-axis scale changes from linear to logarithmic. This tag also changes to
<span class="mcode">LogY</span> so that it always matches the current scaling of 
the y-axis. Clicking again toggles it back to <span class="mcode">LinY</span>.
Right-clicking on this tag opens the plt HardCopy dialog box. See the description
of the HardCopy dialog box below (under the <span class="mcode">Print</span> menu item).

<h3>Grid</h3>

Left-clicking on the Grid tag alternates between no grids (tick marks only)
and full grids on both x and y axes. By default, the grids are solid dim grey lines.
(This may be modified by the GRIDc and GridStyle parameters.)
Grid lines with high contrast colors and brightness (such as what you get with the
native Matlab plot command) makes it more difficult to observe the main data traces.
<br><br>
Assuming the grid style has not been modified with the GRIDc or GridStyle parameters,
right-clicking on the Grid tag will alternate between the following two grid modes:
<ul>
  <li><tt><b>&nbsp;Color = [.13 .13 .13],&nbsp; LineStyle = '-'</b></tt>
  <li><tt><b>&nbsp;Color = [.26 .26 .26],&nbsp; LineStyle = ':'</b></tt>
</ul>

<h3>Zout</h3>

Each left click of the <span class="mcode">Zout</span> (Zoom out) tag expands the 
x and y axes by 40% (20% at each end). This approximately doubles the area of 
the Cartesian plane displayed within the axis limits. (1.4<sup>2</sup> = 1.96). 
Right-clicking on the <span class="mcode">Zout </span>reverses the effect of a 
left click (i.e. zooms in).

<h3>XY<font face="Times New Roman">&#8596;</font></h3>

Each click on the <span class="mcode">XY<font face="Times New Roman">&#8596;</font></span> 
(XYrotate) tag cycles the x and y axis limits to the next 
display expansion stored in a history list. (The axis limits from the last four 
zooms or pans are saved in this list). After all the display limits in the 
history list are used, the next click autoscales both axes so that all the data 
is displayed. The next click again uses the first display expansion in the 
history list. Right-clicking on this tag skips the rotation through the history
list and directly autoscales the axes to show the full x and y extent of the
trace data.

<h3>Print</h3>

Note that the <span class="mcode">Print</span> tag does not appear in the 
menu box by default. It will only appear if enabled by an <span class="mcode">'Options'</span> 
argument in the calling sequence. This is done to reduce clutter and is justified since
this is not a commonly used dialog and because you may also access this by right-clicking
on the LinY tag (mentioned above) as well a from the Hardcopy selection in the plt menu of
the menu bar. (If you don't see the menu bar, click on the <span class="mcode">Menu</span>
tag in the menu box to make the menu bar visible.)
<br>
<img src="../images/Hardcopy.png" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">
<br>This is what the hardcopy dialog looks like when opened.
The primary use of this dialog box is to create BMP bitmapped images of the plt window.
You will see from the popup menu, that you can select other graphics formats as well,
although not all of them are well tested. (This image shows the dialog setup for making
a windows meta file format.) For all file types except BMP, the colors are inverted if
the background is dark. On most printers this makes the copy far more readable and saves
large amounts of toner.
<br><br>
You can also print directly to the default windows printing device from the HardCopy
dialog, although an easier (and possibly more reliable) way of doing this 
is to select &quot;print&quot; from the File menu. And for a bitmapped image,
yet another method is to use the screen capture facility (via the PrintScreen key
on Windows based systems). Before capturing your bit map you may want to right-click
on the y-axis label to hide the menu box and cursor objects so these objects won't
distract from the basic plot data. Right-clicking on the y-axis label a second time
re-enables the cursor objects.

<h3>Mark</h3>

<img src="../images/Marker.png" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left"></p>

<br>When you left-click on the Mark tag, a square marker is placed at the current 
cursor location and a marker string is added to the plot containing the x and y 
coordinates of the cursor location. The text string will be the same color as
the active trace. If the text label is not positioned where you 
want it, click on the label and drag it to the location you want.<br>
<br clear="left">

<img src="../images/MarkerEdit.png" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">
<br>If you right-click on the marker string (which is <span class="mcode">(7.675, 2.95902)</span>
in this example), a new dialog box will appear which 
allows you to change any or all of the properties of both the trace marker (with the
left popup and edit box) and the marker string (with the right popup and edit box).
The two pictures below show the Marker and String properties 
respectively that you can edit.
<br><br>
Note that you can have many of these Edit Marker dialog 
boxes open at same time - as many as one per text string (or even more, although 
there is probably little benefit to that). All these dialog boxes will be 
deleted automatically if the main plot window is deleted.
<br clear="left">

<img src="../images/MarkerEdit2.png" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">
<br>Once you select one of the 8 marker properties, or one of the 10 string 
properties, the current value of the property appears in the respective edit 
box. To change the property value, click in the edit box, and type in a new 
value.
<br><br>
Note that both the Marker and the String popups 
have <span class="mcode">delete</span> as one of the options. This is useful if 
you want to add a marker without a string or a string without a marker. You may 
delete all the markers you have added this way by selecting <span class="mcode">
delete</span> and then typing <span class="mcode">all</span> into the edit box 
below the popup. The same trick works for deleting all the strings added to the 
figure via the Mark tag. If you want to delete all the markers and all the strings
at once choose the "Delete cursor annotations" selection in the plt menu of the
menu bar. (See below, and also note the mouse shortcut for this function.)
<br clear="left">
		
<img src="../images/MarkerEdit3.png" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">
<br>Note that when you select the <span class="mcode">color</span> property, the 
property value is a set of three numbers corresponding to red, green, and blue 
respectively. Each number is an intensity value and must range from zero (off) 
to 1.0 (full intensity). You may change the color by entering the desired rgb 
values. When you press &lt;Enter&gt; the new value will be accepted and you will see 
the marker or string change to the new color. However since it is often 
difficult to predict exactly what these colors look like, plt provides an easier 
way to select new colors. Instead of left-clicking on the rgb triple, use a 
right click. A new color selection box will appear. The use of the color selection 
box (also called a ColorPick pseudo object) appears below.
<br clear="left">
	
<h3>Menu</h3>

Left-clicking on this tag toggles the menu bar on or off. (See the description
of the menu bar below). Note that the initial state of the menu bar is off
unless the (unless <span class="mcode">'options','Menu'</span> appears in the
argument list).

<br><br>
<img src="../images/CursorData.png" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">
<br>Right-clicking on the Menu tag opens up a new window similar to this one shown called
the  <b><i><font size="+1"> Cursor Data Window </font></i></b>. This window shows the
x and y values of all visible plot traces. The down arrows
(<span class="mcode">vvvvvv</span>) highlighted in the middle of this window indicate
that the cursor is currently pointing to the 200th data element of the trace
whose trace ID is "Line 1". As you move the cursor around (by any of the many methods)
the cursor data window will automatically be updated so that arrows always point to
the current cursor location. The cursor index will always be shown near the middle
of the window but you can use the scrollbar on the right side of the figure to view
any of the data values that appear on the plot.
<br><br>
The first column heading is always "index" and the index column will contain all the
integers between 1 and n, where n is the data length of the longest visible trace.
The second column heading is always "X" which indicates that this column contains the
Xdata values of the first visible trace. The 3rd column will contain the y values
of the first visible trace and the column heading will be the traceID. The 4th column
will again have a heading of "X" and will contain the x data for the 2nd visible trace
except (as in this example) when the x values are the same as for the previous trace
in which case the X column is omitted. In this example all 3 traces had the same x vector
so only one column is needed for it. However if the 3 traces each had different x vectors
then the column headings would have been <i>"index,X,Line1,X,Line2,X,Line3"</i>.
<br><br>
If the characters are two big or small for your taste you can adjust the size with the
fontsize popup. Click the save button to create a text file that contains the exact text
that appears in the list box (from index 1 all the way to the end of each plotted
array). The column headings will appear at the very top of the text file.
<br><br>
Note that if you are using subplots, some of the column headings may be blank since
the subplot traces do not use TraceIDs. However if a subplot has a y-axis label
then that label will be used as column heading for the trace inside the subplot.
<br clear="left">

<h2>Menu Bar</h2>

<img src="../images/Menu.png" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">
<br>Usually you will select the desired menu with the mouse. However you may also use the
keyboard. The underlines shown in this figure and in the drop down menus below only
appear when you press the ALT key. When you press the ALT key followed by one of the
underlined characters, the respective dropdown menu will appear. You can then select
one of the dropdown menu items with the mouse or by pressing one of the underlined
characters in the dropdown menu.
<br clear="left">
	
<img src="../images/FileMenu.png" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">
<br>One of the most useful functions of the menu bar is
<span class="mcode">Print</span> (the last item under the
<span class="mcode">File</span> menu). This is probably the easiest and most
reliable way to make a hardcopy of the plt window.
<br><br>
As you can see from the figure to the right, plt adds the 
following two items to the File menu:
<ul>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><span class="mcode">plt&nbsp;save </span>
  saves the current figure so that that it can be opened later 
  (see plt open below). A dialog box opens allowing you to choose the name of 
  the file. A .plt extension is used for these files although in fact they are 
  ordinary .mat files. This menu item is equivalent to typing
  <span class="mcode">plt&nbsp;save</span> at the Matlab command prompt.
  Also at the command prompt, you may type
  <span class="mcode">plt&nbsp;save&nbsp;filename</span> which avoids the file
  dialog box by specifying the file directly and of course the functional form
  <span class="mcode">plt('save','filename')</span> works also.
  
  <li> <span class="mcode">plt&nbsp;open </span>opens a dialog box that allows
  you to select a .plt figure file that was saved with the plt save menu.
  The new window should look and behave the same as the original plt window.
  (Note that if the original plt window was created with a function that provided
  additional plotting features to the plt window, those features will not be
  available after opening the figure.) This menu item is equivalent to typing
  <span class="mcode">plt&nbsp;open</span> at the Matlab command prompt.
  Also at the command prompt, you may type
  <span class="mcode">plt&nbsp;open&nbsp;filename</span> which avoids the file
  dialog box by specifying the file directly. A new window is opened containing
  the data that was saved.
</ul>
<br><br clear="right">
	
<img src="../images/pltMenu.png" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">
<br>The last menu item (<span class="mcode">plt</span>) is unique to plt. 
When you click on this menu item you will see these twelve submenus.
<br><br>
The accelerator keys for selecting one of these submenus are shown in parentheses.
For example to select the "Save figure colors" submenu using the keyboard, you
would first press ALT key followed by the p key (to select the plt menu) and
finally press the s key to select the "Save figure colors" submenu. (You don't have
to release the ALT key before the p key is pressed if you prefer.)
<br><br>
Note that all but three of these submenus have some blue text after them.
These are directions for selecting the submenu action without using the
menu bar (which may be easier, especially when the menu bar is hidden).
For example, the first submenu (Edit line) contains the string
<font color="#4040ff"><i>Rclick Mark</font></i>. This means that you can invoke the
Edit line function by right-clicking on the Mark tag inside the menubox.
The next submenu (Edit all lines) contains the string
<font color="#4040ff"><i>Delta+Rclick Mark</font></i>. What this means is that you
can invoke this menu by first left-clicking on the Delta (&#8710;) button and then
right-clicking on the Mark button. The third submenu (Edit figure colors) contains
the string <font color="#4040ff"><i>Rclick Properties in Ypopup</font></i>. This
means that you should right-click on the Properties selection that appears in the
Yedit popup (that opens when you right-click on the Ycursor edit box). Of course
you won't remember these shortcuts unless you use them often, but you can always
use this menu as a reminder.
<br><br>
These twelve submenus are described in order below:
<br clear="left">
	
<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0">1.) Edit line <font color="#4040ff"><i>Rclick Mark</font></i>
    or <font color="#4040ff"><i>Lclick Properties in Yedit popup</font></i></h3>

<img src="../images/color2.png" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">
<br>To change the color or other property of a trace or of its associated cursor, 
first click on the trace that you want to modify (i.e. make the trace active) 
and then click on the <span class="mcode">Edit&nbsp;line</span> submenu. You 
will see a new figure similar to the this one.
<br><br>
The left side of the Edit Line dialog box 
controls the properties of the active trace and the right side controls the properties 
of the cursor attached to that trace. The properties that appear in both these popups 
are the same as those under &quot;Marker properties&quot; in the Edit Marker dialog box 
shown above. Note that 
one can edit the data plotted by selecting and editing the Xdata or Ydata line properties. This works 
well for simple traces with less than a few dozen data elements. For longer 
sequences you will be better off using&nbsp; the data editing technique described in 
the <a href="Data%20editing.htm">data editing</a> section. Note that (for 
example) if you modify the Ydata property by removing or adding data elements 
that the line will disappear until you also modify the Xdata property by 
removing or adding the same number of points. This is because the line object 
can't be rendered unless the lengths of the Xdata and Ydata properties are the 
same.

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0">2.) Edit all lines <font color="#4040ff"><i>Delta+Rclick Mark</font></i></h3>

<img src="../images/color2a.png" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">
<br>When you select the <span class="mcode">Edit all lines</span> submenu
a dialog box such as this will appear. When you change the popup 
menu to select a new property, the edit box will be updated to show the current 
value of that property for the active trace just as before. However if you then 
change the property value in the edit box, this property will get changed for 
all the traces on the plot, not just the active trace. This is probably not 
appropriate for the color property, but it may be useful for some of the other 
trace properties, such as linewidth. You can also use this dialog box to make 
all the cursors larger or a different shape for instance.
<br clear="left">

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0">3.) Edit figure colors
<font color="#4040ff"><i>Rclick Properties in Yedit popup</font></i></h3>

<img src="../images/color3.png" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">
<br>When you select this submenu this dialog box will appear which allows
you to change all of the figure colors which are not accessible from the
edit lines dialog boxes described above.
<br clear="left">

<img src="../images/color3a.png" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">
<br>This shows the eight items that you can modify from this dialog box.
After selecting one of these items, the current color of that
item appears in the edit box below the popup as a set of three 
intensity numbers corresponding to red, green, and blue respectively. You may 
change the color by left-clicking the edit box and entering the desired rgb 
values or by right-clicking the edit box which will bring up the color selection 
box described at the bottom of this page.
<br><br>
Note that the three property editing windows shown above for the first three
submenus may also be opened from the &quot;Properties&quot; selection that appears
when you right-click on the Yedit cursor.
(See <a href="Data%20editing.htm">Data editing</a>.)
<br clear="left">

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0">4. Save figure colors</h3>

Changing colors inside the plt figure using the color selection box is not 
permanent (i.e. those colors will be forgotten once the application is closed). 
However you can make the changes permanent by selecting this submenu which
will save the current colors to the file (which we call a "color selection file").
You will find the rules  that plt uses to determine the color file name in the
description of the <span class="mcode">'ColorFile'</span> parameter
<a href="../Programming%20with%20plt/Colors.htm">here</a>.
<br><br>
When plt starts, the color for each screen element is determined as follows:
<ul>
  <li>If a color file is found, the color for all screen elements will be 
  determined by the file contents.
  <li>If no color file exists, the colors for particular screen elements are 
  determined by the color parameters included in the plt function call. These 
  parameters are described in the <a href="../Programming%20with%20plt/Colors.htm">Colors</a> section.
  <li>If such a parameter is not included in the function call, then the color 
  for that particular screen element will be specified by the plt default color 
  scheme.
</ul>

These color selection files are in a consistent format so a color file generated in one 
application can be used in another application by renaming the color file, or by 
using the name of the desired color file explicitly with the
<span class="mcode">'ColorFile'</span> parameter. More detailed instructions about
how to modify a color selection file are given in the
<a href="../Quick%20start/Default colors.htm">Default colors</a> section.

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0">5.) Cursor Data Window <font color="#4040ff"><i>Rclick Menu</font></i></h3>
This submenu opens a cursor data window which is described above under the right click
action of the Menubox Menu tag.

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0">6.) Swap X/Y axes <font color="#4040ff"><i>Rclick LinX</font></i></h3>
This submenu performs the action described above under the right click
action of the Menubox LinX tag.

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0">7.) Hardcopy <font color="#4040ff"><i>Rclick LinY</font></i></h3>

This submenu menu opens a dialog box used for printing and creating screen captures
of plt figures. The use of this dialog box is described above in the description of
the menubox Print tag.

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0">8.) Toggle line smoothing <font color="#4040ff"><i>Rclick "o"</font></i></h3>

This submenu toggles the line smoothing property of all plot traces from off to on or
visa versa. This is described in more detail here:
<a href="Cursoring.htm">The Cursor button group</a>

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0">9.) Delete cursor annotations <font color="#4040ff"><i>Delta+Rclick "o"</font></i></h3>

If you have added many plot annotations (with the menubox Mark tag) you can delete
them one by one by selecting delete for the string and/or marker from the
Edit Marker window. However this would be tedious if you have had many annotations.
This submenu provides a way to delete all of them with one simple action.

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0">10.) Set dual cursor</h3>

The dual cursor mode allows you to simultaneously cursor two traces on the same plot. Usually
this is set up using the <span class="mcode">'DualCur'</span> parameter.
(see <a href="../Using%20the%20plt%20window/Cursoring.htm">Dual Cursor</a>). However you may
also use this menu to set the dual cursor interactively. Simply put the cursor on the trace
that you want as the dual cursor (by clicking on it) and then select this submenu. After that
the Dual Cursor will become active on the selected trace. This submenu acts
as a toggle, which means that if the dual cursor was already enabled, it will be disabled.

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0">11.) Toggle Reposition mode <font color="#4040ff"><i>Rclick Delta</font></i></h3>

The reposition mode a key feature of plt's GUI building tool set which allows you to move and resize
screen objects with the mouse. This submenu toggles between the normal GUI mode and the reposition mode
and back. The reposition mode is described in more detail here:
<a href="../Programming%20with%20plt/GUI%20building%20with%20plt.htm">GUI building with plt</a>

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0">12.) Reposition Grid size <font color="#4040ff"><i>Delta+Rclick Delta</font></i></h3>

This submenu brings up a small auxiliary figure titled <span class="mcode">SnapTo</span>
containing two sliders, one for controlling the x step size and the other controlling the y step size of the
GUI object repositioning mode. An example of what this figure looks like and what the values mean can be found here:
<a href="../Programming%20with%20plt/GUI%20building%20with%20plt.htm">GUI building with plt</a>

<h3>The Color Selection box</h3>

<img src="../images/color4.png" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">
<br>When using the &quot;Edit&nbsp;Marker&quot;, &quot;Edit&nbsp;line&quot;,
&quot;Edit&nbsp;all&nbsp;lines&quot;, or &quot;Edit&nbsp;figure&nbsp;colors&quot;
dialog boxes described above, if you right-click on an edit box 
containing an rgb triple, the color selection box will appear.
<br><br>
As with the rgb triples, the three sliders represent the intensity values
(except in percent) and will initially be set to the same values that were in 
the edit box. You can move the sliders (or type in new values) to give the 
proportion of each color that you want. Only integer values between 0 and 100 
are accepted giving you more than a million different colors (101 cubed). As you 
move the sliders, the color of the marker, line, or figure element selected is 
continually adjusted to reflect the slider settings. The color of the large 
rectangular patch to the right of the red slider (called the &quot;current color 
patch&quot;)&nbsp; is also adjusted at the same 
time which makes it easier especially for the smaller screen elements.
<br><br>
To make it easier to find the most pleasing color, the 11 by 11 grid of 
colors is also updated every time a slider is moved. What this grid shows you 
are the colors that result when the intensity value of the active slider is 
mixed with 1 of 11 different intensity values of the two inactive sliders. The 
active slider (i.e. the slider that was last moved) is shown highlighted in 
yellow.
<br><br>
So for example, in the figure above, the bottom slider (blue) is active and 
happens to be set to 0%. This means that all 121 squares of the grid are made up 
of colors containing no blue. Each row of the grid contains a different 
intensity percentage of red (0% for the bottom row, 10% for the next row, and 
100% for the top row). Likewise each column of the grid contains a different 
intensity percentage of green (0% for the left column and 100% for the right 
column). Thus, the upper right square in this example then would be yellow (rgb&nbsp;=&nbsp;[1 1 0]).
<br><br>
When you see a color in the grid that you like, just click on it. The screen 
element selected as well as the current color patch will instantly change to 
be the same as the color you clicked on. Of course the two inactive sliders move 
to show the intensity values of the color you just selected. If you can't find a 
better color, you can revert to the color in effect when you right-clicked on 
the rgb triple by clicking on the current color patch.
<br><br>
All this may sound somewhat complicated, however it is far easier to do than 
to explain. Generally you can pick any of the three sliders, move it around a 
bit, and you will quickly see the color you want in the grid. By the way, 
clicking on the slider trough area moves the slider by 10%, so if you want to 
limit yourself to the 1,331 colors formed with the intensities 
0,10,20,30,...100%, then you can see all such colors after just 10 clicks of the
