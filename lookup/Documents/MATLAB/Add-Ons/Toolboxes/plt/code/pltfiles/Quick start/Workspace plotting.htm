<h3>Starting the workspace plotter</h3>

The workspace plotter is a fast way to plot the variables in your 
current workspace. No more errors from mistyping those long variable names.
Just type <span class="mcode">plt</span> (with no arguments) at the command prompt and a 
window will appear such as the one shown to the left. (This window was actually 
generated with the included
<span class="mcode">pltvar.m</span> script example which creates the variables 
listed and then calls plt with no arguments.) All the variables in your workspace (except for 
scalars and strings) will be listed in the workspace plotter figure. The size of 
the variable (row, column) appears right after the variable name. If your 
workspace contains many variables, the variable list may appear in several 
columns. If your workspace includes 1x1 structures with vector fields 
(such as the bottom two variables in this figure),
then these fields will also appear in the workspace plotter figure using the 
usual structure notation (<span class="mcode">struct.field</span>)

<h3>Choosing an x-vector</h3>

The first thing you should do is select the x-vector that you want to plot 
along the x-axis. As you can see from the instructions (in green) at the top of 
the figure, you should do this by clicking on the desired x-vector using the 
right<sup>1</sup> mouse button. You 
may click on any of the variables shown in white. Note that in this example, the 
variable called <span class="mcode">long_variable_name</span> is grayed out. 
This is because only row or column vectors can be x-vectors. Since
<span class="mcode">long_variable_name</span> has three rows of 400 elements it 
can't be selected as an x-vector.

<br><br><sup>1</sup><font size="2"> Actually in this initial situation you may 
    also select the x-vector with a left click. Usually a left click is 
    used for selecting y-vectors, but since you can't do that without at least
    on selected x-vector it assumes that you are choosing an x-vector in either case.
    For consistency, you still might want to stick with the right click for selecting
    the x-vector - a habit that probably will make workspace plotting easier.</font>

<br clear="left"><br><hr><br>

Suppose you choose to plot the 400 element row vector <span class="mcode">sec</span> 
along the x axis. After you click on that vector, it turns red for identification 
and visibility and <font face="Times New Roman">the tag <span class="mcode">&#8592;x</span></font> 
is placed after the variable name indicating this is the chosen x vector  as 
shown to the left.

<h3>Choosing a y-vector</h3>

Next you must choose the array (or arrays) to plot along the y axis. The plot 
routine requires that one of the dimensions of the y array match the length of 
the x vector. So in this example, the y arrays must have either 400 rows or 400 
columns. In this example five of the variables do not meet this 
condition, so they are grayed out and you will not be allowed to select 
them.

<br clear="left"><br><hr><br>

<img src="../images/PltSel2.png" hspace=8 align=left>
	
Suppose you then click on these 3 array names: <span class="mcode">
long_variable_name</span>, <span class="mcode">psvb1</span>, and
<span class="mcode">s.psvb4</span>. As you click on them, the names will turn 
yellow and the tag <font face="Times New Roman"><span class="mcode">&#8592;y</span></font> 
is placed after the variable names to indicate that these arrays are to be 
plotted along the y axis.

<br><br><img src="../images/PltSel2a.png" hspace=8 align=left>

If you then click on the &quot;Plot&quot; button plt will create a plot containing five 
traces. The first 3 traces will be the 3 rows of the array <span class="mcode">
long_variable_name</span>. The fourth trace will contain the data from
<span class="mcode">psvb3</span> and the last trace will contain the data from
<span class="mcode">s.psvb4</span>. (Note that the order of the traces will be
according to the order that the variables appear in the list and not on the order
that you clicked on them.)

By default, a maximum of 7 characters are used in the TraceID box which means that
some characters may be removed to make it fit. Note that the last character is always
included and underscores are removed to save space. Also note that for arrays with
more than one row or column a row or column index is attached to the end of the name.

<br><br>
Since a single x vector is being used, the x vector name (<span class="mcode">sec</span>) 
is used as the x-axis label. In this example, the y-axis is labeled with <span class="mcode">Y 
axis</span> for lack of anything better. If you had selected just a single 
y-axis variable for plotting, that variable name would be used as the y-axis label.

<br clear="left"><br><hr><br>

<img src="../images/PltSel3.png" hspace=8 align=left>
	
Starting from the previous situation, suppose 
the numbers in psvb1 were far bigger than the other selected y variables. 
Then the other traces would be too small when plotted on the same y-axis 
scale. One way to solve this problem is to plot psvb1 on the right hand axis 
and leave the other variables on the left side. To do this, double click on 
psvb1. Note that its color changes to orange and the <font face="Times New Roman"> <span class="mcode">&#8592;y</span></font> 
changes to <font face="Times New Roman"> <span class="mcode">&#8592;yR</span></font> 
to indicate that this variable will be plotted on the right hand axis. You 
may select as many traces as you want for either the left or right hand axes.
To change a <font face="Times New Roman"> <span class="mcode">&#8592;yR</span>&nbsp;</font>
(orange) to a <font face="Times New Roman"> <span class="mcode">&#8592;y</span>&nbsp;</font>
(yellow) single click a few times on the variable name. (The exact number of 
clicks depends somewhat on the situation.)

<br clear="left"><br><hr><br>

So far we have only selected a single x vector. 
Although this will be sufficient most of the time, the workspace plotter 
allows multiple x vectors to be selected. Suppose you now right-click on
<span class="mcode">seconds</span> and <span class="mcode">vb2rep</span>. 
(Since they are grayed out, they won't accept a left click, but in this 
situation they will accept a right click). These two variables will then 
turn red to indicate that they are to be used as x vectors. They will also 
be marked with <font face="Times New Roman"> <span class="mcode">&#8592;x2</span></font> 
and <font face="Times New Roman"> <span class="mcode">&#8592;x3</span></font> 
respectively and the <font face="Times New Roman"> <span class="mcode">&#8592;x</span> </font>
marking on <span class="mcode">sec</span> will change
to <font face="Times New Roman"> <span class="mcode">&#8592;x1</span></font>. 
The digits after the &quot;<span class="mcode">x</span>&quot; make it easier to know 
which x vector you have selected for each y vector. Also the first two 
variables (<span class="mcode">b1catb3</span> and <span class="mcode">
b2catb4</span>), which were grayed out before, now turn white because these 
800 element row vectors now can be plotted versus either x2 or x3.
<br><br>

Suppose you then click once on both <span class="mcode">b1catb3</span> and
<span class="mcode">b2catb4</span>. They will both turn yellow and be marked 
with <font face="Times New Roman"> <span class="mcode">&#8592;y2</span></font> 
indicating that they should be plotted with respect to <font face="Times New Roman"> <span class="mcode">
x2</span>&nbsp;</font>(<span class="mcode">seconds</span>). In this case there is 
more than one choice of x vectors, so if you click on <span class="mcode">
b2catb4</span> again, its mark changes from
<font face="Times New Roman"> <span class="mcode">&#8592;y2</span></font> 
to <font face="Times New Roman"> <span class="mcode">&#8592;y3</span></font> as shown in
the figure to the left. Since there are no other possible x 
vectors to choose from, if you click on <span class="mcode">b2catb4</span> 
one more time the <font face="Times New Roman"> <span class="mcode">&#8592;y3</span></font> 
mark will disappear and the variable name will change back to white, indicating that it is 
no longer selected.
    
<br clear="left"><br><hr><br>

Every time you click the &quot;Plot&quot; button, the workspace plotter will create
a new figure window containing the plot you specified by the various
<font face="Times New Roman"> <span class="mcode">&#8592;x</span></font> 
and <font face="Times New Roman"> <span class="mcode">&#8592;y</span></font> 
tags. When you have created many plots, pressing the &quot;CloseAll&quot; button is a 
convenient way to close all of these figure windows (although the workspace 
browser window itself remains open).

If you have many long variable names, you may not be happy with TraceIDs of only 7 characters.
In that case, you can specify longer TraceID's tags by typing a 
command such as <span class="mcode">TraceIDlen=17; </span>before calling the 
workspace plotter. (Try this before typing <span class="mcode">pltvar</span>). 
However you will notice one problem. The longer trace names will not fit in
the space reserved for the TraceID box and the characters will run into the
main plot axis. You could solve this problem by using a plt option variable,
which is any variable containing the characters <span class="mcode">pltvar</span>
in the variable name. So for example the variables pltopt, pltopt2, another_pltoption
would all be recognized as plt option variables where as variables pltOpt2
and another_plt_option would not be so recognized because it must contain
the string "pltopt" exactly (including case).
<br><br>
So before starting pltvar, try typing the following two lines at the command prompt:
<br><br>
 <span class="mcode">TraceIDlen=17;<br>
pltopt = {'xy', [0 .24 .12 .74 .86; -1 .01 .83 .2 .15]};</span>
<br><br>
The first row of the xy parameter gives new coordinate locations for the plot (both left & right axes) and
the second row gives new coordinates for the TraceID box. These coordinates can be
generated easily by moving/resizing the objects with the mouse. (To see how, look at the manual section
<a href="../Programming%20with%20plt/GUI%20building%20with%20plt.htm">GUI building with plt</a>).
<br><br>
If you wanted to make the two commands above permanent for all workspace plotting,
create a file on your Matlab path named <span class="mcode">pltdef.m</span>
which contain those two lines. Below are more details about how to use pltdef.m
<br><br>
As an alternative to the 'xy' parameter used above you could use the 'AxisPos' parameter as follows:
<br><br>
<span class="mcode">pltopt = {'AxisPos',[1.8 1 .86 1 2.8]};</span>
<br><br>
This would increase the width of the TraceID box by a factor of 2.8 while letting plt choose
the height of the TraceID box appropriately (an advantage over the 'xy' command). Unfortunately
the AxisPos parameters can't be determined automatically with the GUI building tools. (The "1.8"
tells plt to make the blank space to the left of the axis 80% bigger to make more room for the
TraceIDs and the ".86" tells plt to make the plot width 86% of the former size so that the plot
doesn't run off the right edge.)
<br><br>

<h3>pltdef.m</h3>

<p>If a file named <span class="mcode">pltdef.m</span> exists on your Matlab path then that 
file will be run before the workspace plotter is opened. This file may contain 
any Matlab commands, and are usually used to defining workspace plotter defaults and variables.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: -18">The workspace plotter looks for any variable that 
contains the characters <span class="mcode">pltopt</span> anywhere in its name. If it 
finds any such variables it will use the parameters they contain as arguments to 
plt when you press the &quot;Plot&quot; button. For example suppose <span class="mcode">
pltdef.m</span> contains these two lines:<br>
<br>
<span class="mcode">pltopt1 = {'Options','Menu','Title','This is a plot title'};<br>
pltopt2 = {'FigName','Workspace plotter'};</span><br>
<br>
Then any plot created by the workspace plotter will have its figure menu bar enabled (from Options),
its axis label will be set to 'Frame data' and its figure name will be set to 'Workspace plotter'.
<br><br>
<span class="mcode">pltdef.m</span> may also include other variables or commands unrelated to 
plotting options. For example suppose pltdef.m included these three lines:
<br><br>
<span class="mcode">circleY = exp((0:.04:2)*pi*1j); % 50 point unit circle<br>
circleX = real(circleY);<br>
circleY = imag(circleY);</span><br>
<br>
Then whenever you started the workspace plotter you would see circleX and circleY in
the workspace variables list. This would allow you to add a unit circle to your plot
by selecting these variables from the list (x vs. y) This would be quite useful if you
were often plotting z-plane poles and zeros, Nyquist data, or other data that lives in
the complex plane.
